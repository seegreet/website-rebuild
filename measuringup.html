				<p>Caspian has beautiful proportion and substance. His measurements land him right in the middle of the standards, being neither to small nor too large. He is a very confident boy! Intelligent and learns quickly (We have almost all of the 'thinking' dog games that he loves, and of coarse, an empty cardboard box! =). He is both gentle and playful (especially with children), loves to travel and always is the first to explore anything new.</p>

				<p>Please note that all measurements were taken and recorded during the 2010 American �levage a few hours prior to the written evaluation. Caspian's written evaluation was by Mr. J.C. Larive (President of Les Amis du Berger Picard in France). The actual scanned evaluation along with the comments (in French) can be found here. Mr. Larive really liked Cassie a lot and in his own words describes Cassie as "Excellent dans l'ensenble.." which translates as "Excellent overall!" =) He also personally wrote to Eric (Cassie's breeder in France) to tell him what he thought of Cassie and to help me in anything I might need. I was touched by his care and knew then that Cassie was truly an exceptional dog in more eyes than my own. Caspian's age at the time of measurement was 2yrs and 11 months.</p>

				<p>Caspian also had a temperament test done while we were at the 2010 American �levage (age 2yrs, 11 months) by the American Temperament Test Society. They are the only non for profit here in the USA. We are proud that Caspian passed with flying colors. His number is TT-6-BP here. Caspian also has his Canine Good Citizen (CGC) Certificate and has passed the Therapy Dog International (TDI) test to be able to work as a therapy dog! As a good friend of mine has said, "The proof is in the pudding!" Hooray Cassie!</p>

				Of note: A CHIC (Canine Health Information Center) number is a special number given when a dog has had certain health tests (varies from breed to breed and their specific health concerns) and donates a sample of their DNA. There are many benefits by doing these tests and receiving a CHIC number, especially when trying to protect and preserve the health in a breed with a small gene pool such as the rare and beautiful Berger Picard. But everyone, including the families, breeders, researchers, breed clubs, rescue organizations as well as many other groups dedicated to dogs of any and all breeds as well as those special mixed breeds also benefit from this shared information. More info <a href="http://www.caninehealthinfo.org/chicinfo.html">here</a>.</p>
				 
				<p><span class="bold">Other notes of interest:</span>

				<ul>
					<li>Caspian has only ever had one bath in his life (in the breed description, Berger Picards do not need to be bathed regularly as their coat sheds dirt), at about 12 weeks of age. Until he was about two years old his coat constantly always felt a little dirty to me. We persevered however and a short time before his second birthday, his coat finally got to that stage where the dirt no longer stuck to it. We do rinse him off with water like an old oil cloth every few weeks or so depending on the season and how much he is out and about. Looking back, I am glad we waited it out. His coat does have a beautiful crisp feel to it that I do not think could be duplicated with special shampoos (I could be wrong about that though). It feels rustic, and fits the rest of him beautifully.</li>
					<li>Cassie is minimally vaccinated. We have never used or plan on using topical flea and tick products. He also is trained using positive reinforcement, which we feel very strongly has had an impact on him in the best way!</li>
					<li>Cassie goes on three to four walks per day with various family members.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><span class="bold">DIET &mdash; Variety is the spice of life. And after all, aren't you are what you eat?</span></p>

				<p>We have taken an organic approach to raising our human children, it is a natural extension that we have endeavored to try to do the same for our furry and feathered family memnbers. To that end...</p>

				<p>We are so pleased to have found the only dog food made in a FDA human food plant (where people food is also made), and then actual real people taste test every single batch before it goes out to the stores. It's a comforting thought for us here, that some person somewhere has eaten the batch that Cassie's food is from before he has. It is a dehydrated RAW diet put out by a company called The Honest Kitchen . Cassie is given the Zeal, Love and Embark varieties. We also mix in a bit of dry kibble (which he enjoys) to increase textural variety. Currently we are rotating through Acana Regionals (Ranchlands, Wild Prarie, and Grasslands). We also add/combine his diet with lots of organic, kosher, and natural whole meats (always hormone and antibiotic free), vegetables (minced fine into his food), fruits (also minced fine), etc. that the whole family can and does eat together. In addition he also recieves on an alterneatng basis, The Honest Kitchen's Sparkle, Invigor, and Perfect Form supplements. Cassie also gets the Metagenics Ultra Flora Synergy probiotic which was recommended by the Holistic Veterinary Center (we were on a wait list for over a year to go to this vet and she was well worth the wait!). The training treats we use are always organic, kosher, and/or homemade =)</p>
