				<h2>Once upon a time...</h2>

				<p>Caspian was born in Saint-Tugdual, Bretagne, France, on October 30, 2007. On a farm, rolling around in the straw, with the sheep, chickens, and playing with his brothers, sisters, and his mom, he spent his first eight weeks. That's when he was chosen to come here to the USA; and so, along with one brother and sister, he traveled over seas to come to New Jersey, where he was met, for the first time, by a boy of seven years, and the boy's papa. He was not at all afraid, and was curious about the camera and the boy who took his picture during the long ride home to New Hampshire. His name, Caspian, was inspired by the character 'Prince Caspian', from the "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" by C.S. Lewis. It was our oldest son's favorite book and character at the time. It fit him perfectly then, and, we think he has continued to grow into a kind, brave, gentle and even tempered gentleman - who is sometimes stubborn, occassionally full of himself, has a great sense of humor, and who always seems to be happy.</p>

				<p>Even after his long trip, being seperated from his family, and a host of new sights, sounds, and people, by the time Caspian left the car to come into his new home for the very first time, he was happy! Wagging his tail and exploring for as long as he could before flopping down exhausted on a warm throw rug lying next to the refridgerator. Caspian liked to run. And run and run and run (and he still does)! Caspian also liked to explore, and give kisses and then run some more (and he still does =) Cassie plays with our then not yet one year old son. Unfortunately, he was full of various worms, giardia, and mites when he first came to us. Any and all of which I was terrified of the baby (especially so), my older son, any of his friends, or anyone else catching. His early socialization included me sitting outside at the grocery store, in the middle of January, with antiviral/bacterial wipes and doggie treats, explaining to everyone who wanted to pet and treat him why they had to use the wipes. It was...an experience not soon forgotten. It was really good for him though as he got used to people of every description, wheelchairs, buses, cars, trucks, motorized carts etc etc. I cannot think of a better place to have socialized him. Finally, after being treated for what we hoped/hope for good of the giardia and the worms (the vet said it can take years to tell about the giardia), he received his one and only bath to date. It was a medicated shampoo to get rid of those mites. After testing clear of everything, he began puppy/obedience 1 class. His socilization also included, after all the parasites were cleared, visiting my son's school, where he got to see/meet/greet children of many ages running around and around and acting like... children</p>

				<p>Cassie also started doggie daycare, which he enjoyed immensely. At first, being a puppy, his trainer thought he would do good with the little dogs, in order build up confidence. When he was ready, he moved in with the big boys, where he was able to play till his hearts content. Cassie was, in the beginning, afraid of the vacuum. We got through this with lots of praise, treats, and some help from our puppy trainer.</p>

				<p>We also have encouraged Cassie to be a "thinking" dog. After reading a few books by people like Karen Pryor, we began by placing an empty box in the middle of the room and brought Cassie into the room. He immediately went over to the box to sniff it, and with this he got clicked and treated. He learned that by pushing the box, turning over the box, etc that he would get rewarded. After a few go overs of this kind of training with various objects (some new and some he already knew, he has learned to play by himself, with all kinds of objects in a safe and fun way. He is also unafraid of new objects and uses his curiosity to investigate. He opens doors (both ways), throws balls (or other various toys) and catches them himself, etc etc. He uses his mind, and that, we think, is a very good thing!</p>

				<p>When Cassie was just over a year old, and while the family (except myself as I was 8 months pregnant) was on vacation out of the country. Caspian got the opportunity to meet, and play with (as only lots of human guys in a group with a dogs dog seem to be able to do) a number of different workmen including: carpenter, masonry, cleaning, a mold remitigation crew and excavating men. Via a wonderful water tank leak I did not notice until it was an enormous problem. There was the packing crew of guys and gals who came and packed and unpacked things up as by that time there was only a couple of weeks till the our third child was due. We had to have a complete renovation. What a mess for us, but, what an opportunity for Cassie! All the workmen were so wonderful! They treated Cassie like a long lost buddy. Of coarse, he ate it all up with great enthusiasm! Even now, a couple of years later, when seeing a truck or hearing men with lawn mowers, leaf blowers, or any other constructive equipment, delivery men, and especially the mailman (who always seems to have a milkbone handy) etc, he is so excited to say hello!</p>

				<p>Cassie begins herding with "Mac" MacGregor (see the 'Meet Mac' link on the left of his menubar). He is probably one of the best herding working/trial dog trainers there are. If you have never seen wild cattle being dog broke by a team of dogs, then you should! He has some videos on You Tube of his dogs doing just that, its really amazing, and we feel privilaged to have had Cassie begin his training with him. Cassie's first meeting with sheep can only be described as a duck to water or a peanut butter to jelly kind of meeting. I do not think I have ever seen such a dog so happy, he was in his glory. And he was beautiful to watch. I have not seen any other Berger Picards herd but it must be a truely beautiful site. Initially Cassie demonstrated gathering and bringing them in on his own, however, he also at 8 months was full of play, with his tail up and some barking when the sheep did not do what he wanted them to do. He did some work alone and also with two working champion border collies. I think those first few lessons were when I felt I saw into Cassie's heart. He was so natural and fluid. Ill never forget it.</p>

				<p>We live in suburbia, on a parcel of land a little less than 1/4 acre. We knew that to keep Cassie healthy, happy, and sound, we needed to involve him continually in a variety of activities to stimulate his mind and body. We have really worked hard to continually involve him in all sorts of classes/activities, with the best trainers, both for us and for him, that we could/can find. As a family, he also goes on plenty of outings to various places and walks, has four toy boxes full of toys at home. We have never used or plan on using any small animal squeaking toys as we understand that they mimic the killing of a small animal and that is not something we want to encourage. We do however have many many interesting for him toys, including the "thinking" toys that deliver treats and his kibble to him after figuring the "trick" to deliver. And of coarse, a free flight parrot who actually plays with him - chasing him around the house (he always bows and barks to initiate this play and goes to the bed under the kitchen table if he is not in the mood for the bird to chase him, which she respects). I am at home most of the day, every day, so a crate was only ever used to get him used to being in a crate, so he would not be afraid of them. He also loves to play with the kids when they are building block castles, by knocking them around. They however, are not always so happy about that! There are a number of other human children's toys he has learned to play with all by himself too! If I can manage to capture the act(s) in a still photo (as none of the playing is a trained behavior), I will link those photos here.</p>

				<p>Cassie tends to follow us all around the house. Although he is almost always in our company, he is ok when left home alone. We also used to occasionally take him to overnight to the place where we decided we'd board him before we went on vacation just so he would learn that even if/when we did/do leave that we would/will always come back.</p>

				<p>Caspian is our first dog as a family. My husband and I had one dog each prior to adopting Cassie, and prior even to meeting each other! We do not consider ourselves to be experienced dog people by any means, although we are learning, and do a lot of reading/research with many questions for the various people we have chosen to work with us and Cassie. We are doing the best we know how and feel very much in love with our four legged, furry family member! We are excited about the experiences we have yet to share with Cassie and will continue to always do the best we can for him. And although Cassie is only our first dog together as a family, there are, I hope, many more Berger Picards in our future.</p>
