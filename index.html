				<p>Hello! My name is Caspian de Lann Guic, but to my friends and family I am just Cassie. I was born on October 30, 2007. Thats right, im an All Hallows Eve doggie! I love people of all kinds and 4 legged creatures of every kind. I even share my home with a couple of two legged flying creatures. I love to play and have fun - but then, doesn't every happy doggie? My mum says im a good dog, and the trainers I have had an opportunity to work with also think im pretty great stuff. I think they even have some notes that are here on my website that explains what I'm like when my family is not around. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention my most favorite pastime....herding sheep! WOW!! Nothing like it, and nothing beats it! I even have a few pictures in my album with the sheep I had an opportunity to work with!</p>
				<p>There is some great additional info at the top of the page, including pictures, family tree, registry etc... Oh, and if you have any questions, comments, or stories to share, you can contact my mum by any of the methods listed below.<br>
				Au revoir!</p>
 
				<p>PS - Fun Fact!<br>
				I have a few sons and daughters now who look just like me and their beautiful momma (she is the love of my life!). Their great-great-grandfather was one of the boys that played a starring role in the movie "Because of Winn-Dixie"!<br>
				*cheers*</p>
