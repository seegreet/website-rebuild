			<p>Hello!</p>

			<p>My name is Caspian de Lann Guic, but to my friends and family I am just Cassie.</p>

			<p>I was born on October 30, 2007. Thats right, im an All Hallows Eve doggie! I love people of all kinds and 4 legged creatures of every kind. I even share my home with a couple of two legged flying creatures. I love to play and have fun - but then, doesn't every happy doggie? My mum says im a good dog, and the trainers I have had an opportunity to work with also think im pretty great stuff. I think they even have some notes that are here on my website that explains what I'm like when my family is not around. Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention my most favorite pastime....herding sheep! WOW!! Nothing like it, and nothing beats it! I even have a few pictures in my album with the sheep I had an opportunity to work with!</p>

			<p>There is some great additional info to the left of the page, including notes from my trainers, family tree, registry etc...</p>

			<p>Oh, and if you have any questions, comments, or stories to share, you can contact my mum by any of the methods listed below.<br>
			Au Revoir!</p>

			PS - Fun Fact!<br>
			I have a few sons and daughters now who look just like me and their beautiful momma (she is the love of my life!). Their great-great-grandfather was one of the boys that played a starring role in the movie "Because of Winn-Dixie"!<br>
			*cheers*
